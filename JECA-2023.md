```markdown
## 1. What is the output of the following program ? 
```
```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 void main ( ) 
 { 
  int a = 40; 
  float b; 
  b = ++a; 
  printf(“%d, %f”, a, ++b); 
 } 
```

```bash
 (A) 41, 42.000000 (B) 41, 42 
 (C) 41, 41.000000 (D) 41, 41
```

> `(A) 41, 42.000000`

```markdown
## 2. What is the output of the following program ? 
```
```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 void main ( ) 
 { 
  int a = -7; 
  float b; 
  b = a++; 
  printf(“%d, %f”, a, ++b); 
 } 
```
```bash
 (A) -6, -7.000000 (B) -5, -6 
 (C) -6, -6.000000 (D) -6, -6
```

```
 a++ post-increments a. b = a++ assigns the current value of a (-7.0) to b, then increments a to -6.
 ++b pre-increments b to -6.0.
 printf prints a as -6 and ++b as -6.000000.
 ```

 > `(C) -6, -6.000000 ✔`

 ```markdown
 ## 3. What is the output of the following program ? 
 ```
 ```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 void main ( ) 
 { 
  int i = -1; 
  printf(“sizeof(i) = %d”, sizeof(i)); 
 } 
 ```

 ```bash
 (A) Compiler Error (B) sizeof(i) = -1 
 (C) sizeof(i) = 1 (D) sizeof(i) = 4 
 ```

 ```
 sizeof Operator: The sizeof operator returns the size, in bytes, of its operand. In this case, the operand is the variable i, which is of type int.
 size of int: In most modern 32-bit and 64-bit C environments, the size of an int data type is 4 bytes. The value stored in the variable (-1) does not affect its size.

 sizeof returns the bytes on the basis of data type
 ```

 > `(D) sizeof(i) = 4`

```markdown
## 4. What is the output of the following program ?
```

 ```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 void main( ) 
 { 
  int x = -1, y = 1, z = 0; 
  if(x && y++ && z) 
   ++x, y++, --z; 
  printf(“%d, %d, %d”, x++, y++, z++); 
 } 
 ```
 ```bash
 (A) 0, 3, 0 (B) Compiler Error 
 (C) -1, 2, 0 (D) 1..0
 ```
 ```
 The condition x && y++ && z evaluates to (-1 && (y++=1) && 0). Since z is 0 (false), the condition fails. However, y++ is evaluated, so y becomes 2.
 The if block is skipped.
 printf prints the current values: x=-1, y=2, z=0. Then, due to post-increment, the variables are updated after printing.
 ```
 > `(C) -1, 2, 0`

## 5. What is the output of the following program ? 
```

 ```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 enum colors{RED, BROWN, ORANGE}; 
 void main( ) 
 { 
  printf (“%ld..%f..%d”, RED, BROWN, ORANGE); 
 } 
 ```

 ```bash
 (A) Compiler Error (B) 0..0.000000..1 
 (C) 0..1.000000..2 (D) Runtime Error 
 ```
  > `(A) Compiler Error`
 
```markdown
## 6. What is the output of the following program ?
```

 ```c 
 #include <stdio.h> 
 void main ( ) 
 { 
  char M = ‘M’; 
  printf(“%d, %c”, M, M); 
 } 
 ```
 ```bash
 (A) Runtime Error (B) Compiler error 
 (C) 76, M (D) 77, M 
 ```

 > `(D) 77, M `
 
 ```markdown
 ## 7. What is the output of the following program ? 
 ```

 ```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 void main( ) 
 { 
  int i = -9; 
  printf(“%d %d %d”, i++, ++i, ++i); 
 } 
 ```

 ```bash
 (A) Compiler error (B) -6 -7 -8 
 (C) -7 -7 -8 (D) -7 -6 -6 
 ```

 ```
 ++i → pre-increment (increments first, then returns new value).
 In C, the order of evaluation of function arguments is unspecified.
 i++, ++i, and ++i are all modifying i. But there is no sequence point between them. So the result depends on the order the compiler chooses to evaluate arguments.
 This means the program causes undefined behavior in C.
 ```
 
 > `(D) -7 -6 -6`

```markdown
## 8. What is the output of the following program ?
```

 ```c 
 #include<stdio.h> 
 void main( ) 
 { 
  int **ptr; // declares a double pointer. This pointer itself is uninitialized, meaning it holds a garbage address.
  int temp = 65; 
  ptr[0] = &temp; // The line ptr[0] = &temp; attempts to store the address of temp (which is 65) into the memory location pointed to by the uninitialized ptr. This causes a Segmentation Fault. Since ptr is uninitialized, trying to access the memory it points to (*ptr) will likely cause a runtime error.
  printf(“%d”, ptr[0][0]); 
 } 
```
 ```bash
 (A) Compiler error (B) 65 
 (C) Segmentation Fault (D) Runtime Error 
 ```
 ```
 The pointer ptr is declared but not initialized. It does not point to any valid memory location. The statement ptr[0] = &temp; tries to write to an arbitrary memory address, which causes a segmentation fault.
 ```
  
  > `Segmentation Fault` 

```markdown
## 9. What is the output of the following program ? 
```

 ```c
 #include <stdio.h> 
 #include <stdlib.h> 
 void main( ) 
 { 
  int *ptr; 
  ptr = (int*) calloc(3, sizeof(int)); 
  ptr[2] = 30; 
  printf(“%d”, *ptr); 
  free(ptr); 
 } 
 ```

 ```bash
 (A) 30 (B) 0 
 (C) calloc (D) Error 
 ```

 ```
  The calloc function initializes the allocated memory to zero.
  *ptr is the first element of this zero-initialized array, so it prints 0.
 ```
